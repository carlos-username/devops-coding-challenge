# DevOps Coding Test

Microservice using Amazon ECS, AWS CloudFormation, and a load balancer.

The goal is to create a docker microservice in Amazon ECS and a healthcheck script to verify its status by means of the following guidelines:
- Publicly accesible on port 80
- Returning the current time in json format on /now
- Deployment by using CloudFormation, and a server configuration management tool if needed (Ansible will be used).
- A healthcheck python script in that can be run externally to periodically check if the service is up and its clock is not desynchronised by more than 1 second.

### Prerequisites üìã


First, some things you will need:

```
Ansible at least 2.7
Amazon console api
An Amazon AWS account
IAM credentials to login to the AWS account (will be provided)
Python 3+
Virtualenv
```

For reference, the webservice was deployed by using MacOS Mojave 10.14.5.

### Overview üîß

The repository contains a set of templates launching the following:

 - A [VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html) with public and private subnets, spanning an AWS region.
 - A highly available ECS cluster deployed across two [Availability Zones](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) in an [Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) group and that are AWS SSM enabled.
 - A pair of [NAT gateways](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) (one in each zone) to handle outbound traffic.
 - One microservice deployed as [ECS service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) (WebService using Flask python Web framework). 
 - An [Application Load Balancer (ALB)](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/applicationloadbalancer/) to the public subnets to handle inbound traffic.
 - ALB path-based routes for each ECS service to route the inbound traffic to the correct service.
 - Centralized container logging with [Amazon CloudWatch Logs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html).

## Deployment üì¶

Configure amazon keys (aws_secret_key and aws_access_key) which can be retrieved from amazon console for your user:
```
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: aws_access_key
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: aws_secret_key
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]: json
```

The orchestration as well as deployment happen through ansible, thus, you can trigger it as follows:
```
ansible-playbook main.yml
```

it will then use the next templates:

| Template | Description |
| --- | --- | 
| [infrastructure/vpc.yaml](infrastructure/vpc.yaml) | this does not only orchestrates a VPC including a pair of public and private subnets distributed across two Availability Zones, but it also deploys an [Internet gateway](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html), with a default route on the public subnets. Moreover, a pair of NAT gateways (one in each zone), and default routes for them in the private subnets are deployed. |
| [infrastructure/security-groups.yaml](infrastructure/security-groups.yaml) | It is possible to configure the [security groups](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html) required by the entire stack on this template.|
| [infrastructure/load-balancers.yaml](infrastructure/load-balancers.yaml) | Launches an ALB to the public subnets exposing the ECS services.|
| [infrastructure/ecs-cluster.yaml](infrastructure/ecs-cluster.yaml) | Deploys an ECS cluster attaching the private subnets to it by using an Auto Scaling group and installs an AWS SSM agent with related policy requirements. |
| [services/WebService.yaml](services/WebService.yaml) | this deploys an ECS service using a customized image from an amazon ecr registry. Furthermore, the Docker webservice shows the current time on /now . The source for this service is here [services/app](services/app/). |

Output is as follows:
```
PLAY [localhost] ******************************************************************************************************************************

TASK [Create VPC with pair of public and private subnets accross two AZ zones and an internet Gateway with default route] *********************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Creating security groups] ***************************************************************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Create load balancer] *******************************************************************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Create ECS Cluster for containers] ******************************************************************************************************

```

## Testing ‚öôÔ∏è

### Adjusting ECS instance Type

This is specified in the main ansible playbook (main.yml)

By default, [t2.micro](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) instances are utilized and can be changed on the ansible main.yml file.

```
- name: Create ECS Cluster for containers
      cloudformation:
        stack_name: ECS-Cluster1
        ........
        template: "{{ ecs_cluster }}"
        template_parameters:
         .......
          InstanceType: t2.micro
          ClusterSize: 2
          .......
        region: eu-central-1
      register: ecs_cluster
```

The Auto Scaling group scaling policy given by default launches and maintains a cluster of 2 ECS hosts distributed across two Availability Zones (min: 2, max: 2, desired: 2). 

### Change the VPC or subnet IP ranges

This set of templates deploys the following network design:

| Item | CIDR Range | Usable IPs | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VPC | 10.180.0.0/16 | 65,536 | The whole range used for the VPC and all subnets |
| Public Subnet | 10.180.8.0/21 | 2,041 | The public subnet in the first Availability Zone |
| Public Subnet | 10.180.16.0/21 | 2,041 | The public subnet in the second Availability Zone |
| Private Subnet | 10.180.24.0/21 | 2,041 | The private subnet in the first Availability Zone |
| Private Subnet | 10.180.32.0/21 | 2,041 | The private subnet in the second Availability Zone |

Values can be modified within the ansible main.yml file.

```
 - name: Create VPC with pair of public and private subnets accross two AZ zones and an internet Gateway with default route
      cloudformation:
        stack_name: VPC-ECS1
        ........
        template: "{{ vpc_template }}"
        template_parameters:
          .........
          VpcCIDR: 10.180.0.0/16
          PublicSubnet1CIDR: 10.180.8.0/21
          PublicSubnet2CIDR: 10.180.16.0/21
          PrivateSubnet1CIDR: 10.180.24.0/21
          PrivateSubnet2CIDR: 10.180.32.0/21
        region: eu-central-1
      register: vpc_stack
```

## Running Healthcheck script
Create a python 3 virtual environment and install the requirenments by using the requirements.txt. 
Steps are shown next:
initialize the virtual environment with python 3:
```
virtualenv3 -p python3 .venv
```
Acvitvate the virtualenvironment:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Install dependencies:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the healthcheck script by providing the Load balancer URL:
```
python3 status.py URL_SITE
    URL_SITE is the url from the load balancer
```
Output is as follows:
```
(.venv) ‚ûú  WebServiceChallenge git:(master) ‚úó python3 status.py http://URL/now
{'current_time': '20:11:51'}
-2208919689.0
21:11:51
-2208916089.0
today time is greater
http://URL/now        200

```

## Built With üõ†Ô∏è
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Interpreted programming language.
* [Flask web framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/) - Used to create the webservice in a more robust way (launches its own http server)
* [Cloudformation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/quickref-ecs.html) - Used to generate templates to deploy infrastructure in AWS.
* [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html) - Software configuration management tool to run the templates and launch any updates, basically an IT automation tool.
